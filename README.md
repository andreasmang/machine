MACHINE &copy; 2020--2023 [Andreas Mang](http://www.math.uh.edu/~andreas): This is a collection of Matlab code snippets to explore conceptual ideas for <strong>MA</strong>thematical and <strong>C</strong>omputational met<strong>H</strong>ods for <strong>IN</strong>verse probl<strong>E</strong>ms. This toolkit is primarily designed to serve as a teaching tool for classes on inverse problems and related topics.


## Help

Problem sets for homework assignments are implemented in the subfolder 'prbsets'. Functions that might be potentially relevant for multiple problems are added to the 'core' sufolder. To add this folder to your path (so MATLAB can find these implementation while you work in the subfolders) simply run the 'istartup.m' file once at the beginning your session.
